# Recurrent Neural Networks

This will have some examples of different recurrent models.

### Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) models

This type of model has the ability to map and input to an output without an explicit label. This is done by creating a vector representation of the input sequence and a vector representation of the output sequence and finding similarities between the two. These are high dimensional vectors that are hard to visualize in 3D space, but are easy for computers to process.

### Bidirectional LSTM networks for Crypto Currency Analysis

The combined use of LSTM cells in a bidirectional form and historical pricing data can help us predict the market price for a given coin, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, IOTA, BTH, etc...


### Bidirectional LSTM networks for Stock Price Prediction

Using LSTM cells in a Bidirectional manor to predict the price of a company's stock. Works for any stock, i.e. GOOG, AAPL, TSLA, etc...
