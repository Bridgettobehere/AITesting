# AI Testing

## The journey to understanding intelligence

This repository will contain many demo projects to further my understanding of Artificial Intelligence.

### Repository content

Demo projects may include

* [1st, and 2nd order optimization algorithms](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande311/lecture13.pdf)
* Trained models, part of [Apple's CoreML Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)
* [Tensor Flow projects](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)
* [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) with [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/)
* [Tesseract LSTM OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-LSTM) (Long Short Term Memory)
* "All Natural" Recurrent Neural Networks (without Frameworks)
* Convolutional Neural Network Exploration
* [Dropout function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(neural_networks)) exploration


### Real world examples

Using AI, companies such as Tesla Motors, Google, Volvo and others are able to create self driving cars that are able to predict accidents before they happen and stop the vehicle from crashing.

Google has the ability to beat pro chess and go players only after a few games.

Researchers have also been able to replicate a speakers voice just using an image file created by using a simple Fourier Transform. Speed improved by removing the undertones and allowing the overtones to produce the undertones.
