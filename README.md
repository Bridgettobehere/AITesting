# AI Testing

## The journey to understanding intelligence

This repository will contain many demo projects to further my understanding of Artificial Intelligence.

### Repository content

Demo projects may include

* [1st, and 2nd order optimization algorithms](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande311/lecture13.pdf)
* Trained models, part of [Apple's CoreML Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)
* [Tensor Flow projects](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)
* [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) with [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/)
* [Tesseract LSTM OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/4.0-with-LSTM) (Long Short Term Memory)
* "All Natural" Recurrent Neural Networks (without Frameworks)
* Convolutional Neural Network Exploration
* Recurrent Neural Networks


### Real world examples

Using AI, companies such as Tesla Motors, Google, Volvo and others are able to create self driving cars that are able to predict accidents before they happen and stop the vehicle from crashing.

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using Bidirectional LSTM Sequence to Sequence Models has the ability to translate between different languages using only pre-translated phrase pairs. The machine is not told the translation between words but rather learns the representations between words on its own.
